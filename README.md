## 3rd-Semester Codebase Documentation

This codebase appears to contain C and C++ programs developed during the 3rd semester of a computer science course. The files are organized by day, reflecting a structured learning process. 

### Day 1 - Basic Programming Concepts

* **barasat, barasat.c, prabhatsir, prabhatsir.c, str_palindrome, str_palindrome.c:** These files likely contain programs demonstrating basic concepts like string manipulation, palindrome checking, and possibly basic arithmetic operations. 
* **bubble, bubble.c:**  This appears to be a program implementing the bubble sort algorithm for sorting arrays. 
* **rough, rough.c:** A file for rough work or experimental code snippets. 
* **questions1.txt:** A text file containing practice questions or assignment tasks for the day. 

### Day 2 -  Functions, Arrays, and Pointers

* **adamas_marking_system, adamas_marking_system.c:** This could be a program simulating a marking system, possibly using arrays to store student information and grades. 
* **array-pointer, array-pointer.c:**  A file demonstrating the relationship between arrays and pointers in C, likely including examples of pointer arithmetic and array manipulation.
* **distance, distance.c:** Possibly a program calculating distance between two points, perhaps using the Euclidean distance formula. 
* **fibonacci, fibonacci.c, fibo_optimised, fibo_optimised.c:** Implementations of the Fibonacci sequence algorithm, potentially comparing performance between the recursive and optimized iterative approaches.
* **main, main.c:**  A file containing the main function of a program, potentially incorporating elements from other files for a larger project. 
* **questions.txt:** Contains practice questions or assignment tasks for day 2, likely focusing on functions, arrays, and pointers.
* **str_func_replica, str_func_replica.c:**  A file replicating string manipulation functions using custom functions.
* **vowel, vowel.c:**  This program likely checks if a given character is a vowel. 

### Day 3 -  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Introduction

* **atm, atm.cpp:** A program implementing a simple ATM system using the principles of object-oriented programming in C++. 
* **shopping_list, shopping_list.cpp:** A program simulating a shopping list, demonstrating object-oriented features like classes and objects.

### Day 4 -  Arrays, Functions, and Recursive Algorithms

* **avgStudent, avgStudent.cpp:** A program that calculates the average grade for a group of students. 
* **employeeDetails, employeeDetails.cpp:**  A program handling employee data, possibly using arrays to store information and functions for data manipulation.
* **questions.txt:** Practice questions or assignments related to arrays, functions, and recursion. 
* **reversePascal, reversePascal.cpp:**  A program that generates a reverse Pascal's triangle.
* **towerOfHanoi, towerOfHanoi.cpp:**  An implementation of the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle using recursion.

### Day 5 -  Additional Topics

* **questions.txt:** Practice questions or assignments for day 5. 
* **shapeArea, shapeArea.cpp:**  A program calculating the area of different shapes. 
* **simpleInterest, simpleInterest.cpp:** A program calculating simple interest.

### Summary

This codebase appears to be a valuable resource for students learning C and C++ programming. It provides examples of basic programming concepts, functions, arrays, pointers, recursion, and introductory object-oriented programming. By examining and understanding the code within each file, students can gain a strong foundation in these core concepts.
